      I am an aspiring developer based in South Africa who has embarked on an
      intensive <em>Self-taught</em> process focusing on computer programming
      and software development, specializing particularly in web design and web
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I build up my experience base, my intention is to step into the realm
      of AI <em>(Artificial Intelligence)</em> and machine learning. Coupled to
      this, Data Science is another endeavor that I wish to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a young man who has recently completed his matriculation, I recognised
      that the domain of web development and web design require three
      fundamental criteria to progress:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Assimilating the right blend of languages, techniques and processes that
        add commercial value.
      </li>
      <li>The importance of creativity.</li>
      <li>Gleaning practical experience.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This has been achieved thus far through the intensive learning programs &
      project facillitation to provide a solid pragmatic foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though web design and development are in constant flux, I believe
      that I am adequately competent in the fundamental's to add value and
      expedite my growth learning curve to benefit potential clients. To
      summerise, I am looking for practical experience within the right working
      environment that offers mentorship.
